Symbolica - Deterministic Rule Engine for AI Agents
==================================================

Replace unpredictable LLM reasoning with deterministic, traceable rule execution.

Key Benefits:
- Deterministic: Same inputs â†’ same outputs, every time  
- Traceable: Full explanation of why decisions were made
- Scalable: Handles 1000+ rules efficiently using dependency analysis
- Fast: Sub-millisecond execution for real-time agent decisions

Quick Start:
    ```python
    from symbolica import Engine
    
    rules = '''
    rules:
      - id: high_value_customer
        priority: 100
        condition: "amount > 1000 and status == 'active'"
        actions:
          tier: premium
          discount: 0.15
    '''
    
    engine = Engine.from_yaml(rules)
    result = engine.reason({"amount": 1500, "status": "active"})
    print(result.verdict)  # {"tier": "premium", "discount": 0.15}
    ```

Advanced Loading:
    ```python
    # From file
    engine = Engine.from_file("rules.yaml")
    
    # From directory (recursive)
    engine = Engine.from_directory("rules/")
    
    # From YAML string
    engine = Engine.from_yaml(yaml_content)
    ```
